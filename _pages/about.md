## ABOUT
I am a PhD student in the [Department of City and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley](https://ced.berkeley.edu/city). I hold a Bachelor in Economics from the University of São Paulo and a Master’s degree in Public and Urban Policy from The New School. I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. Prior to commencing my PhD, I worked in different public and private sector organizations for nine years on issues of housing and land use policy, real estate, and urban economic development in Brazil and the U.S. During this period I also pursued my passion for public policy as a research associate at the [Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis](https://www.economicpolicyresearch.org/),  as an independent researcher for the [Lincoln Institute of Land Policy](https://www.lincolninst.edu/).  



## RESEARCH INTEREST
I am interested in exploring the role of land and housing policies in promoting or reducing different dimensions of **inequality**. My current research focuses on how **access to credit/ homeownership** policies impact wealth-building and the spatial and economic mobility of different populations in Brazil and the US. I am also interested in exploring the limits and possibilities of the concept of **housing financialization** to refer to housing policies and institutions implemented in the Global South. Another of my research interests relates to the implementation of **urban land-based financing instruments** in Brazil and the US, and their impact on municipal finances, spatial inequality, and urban economic development. In approaching these topics, I integrate quantitative and qualitative methods. 


## RECENT AND ONGOING PROJECTS
 • I am currently working on a project led by Prof.  Nick Tsivanidis (Berkeley Economics Dep.) on **land value capture tools** in São Paulo, focused on the auction of CEPACs/air rights in Urban Operations. 

 • I have recently worked as a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) at the [Terner Center for Housing Innovation](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/) with Prof. Carolina Reid, analyzing access to credit in BIPOC communities in the U.S, using **home mortgage microdata**.

 • Recently, I co-authored [a policy report](https://reinventalbany.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Reinvent-Albany_SCEPA-Penn-Station-Redevelopment-Report-2022-July-12.pdf) with Bridget Fisher (the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis), shining a light onto the use of **land value capture** to finance Penn Station's redevelopment plan in NYC. This research was featured in some media outlets, such as [The NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/nyregion/penn-station-renovation-funding.html) and [NY Daily News](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-edit-penn-station-finances-20220718-f5jkok5ar5fkfdf66a4jxaiaiy-story.html)

 • I am co-creator and regular co-host of the [Sur-Urbano podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1hD093fkWBYB0S6f2h3epH), an initiative of the Latin American Cities working group at UC Berkeley.
