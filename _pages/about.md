## ABOUT
I am a PhD student in the Department of City and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley. I hold a Bachelor in Economics from the University of São Paulo and a Master’s degree in Public and Urban Policy from The New School. I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. Prior to commencing my PhD, I worked in different public and private sector organizations for nine years on issues of housing and land use policy, real estate, and urban economic development in Brazil and the U.S. During this period I also pursued my passion for public policy as a research associate at the [Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis](https://www.economicpolicyresearch.org/),  as an independent researcher for the [Lincoln Institute of Land Policy](https://www.lincolninst.edu/).  



## RESEARCH INTEREST
I am interested in exploring the role of land and housing policies in advancing or limiting **inequality**. My current research focuses on how **access to credit/ homeownership** policies impact wealth-building and the spatial and economic mobility of different populations in Brazil and the US. I am also interested in exploring the limits and potentialities of the concept of **housing financialization** to refer to housing policies implemented in the Global South. Another research interest of mine relates to the implementation of land-based financing instruments both in Brazil and in the US, and their implications for municipal finances, spatial inequality, and economic development. I plan to integrate quantitative methods and qualitative methods to answer these questions.


## RECENT AND ONGOING PROJECTS
 • I am currently working on a project led by Prof.  Nick Tsivanidis (Berkeley Economics Dep.) on **land value capture tools** in São Paulo, focused on the auction of CEPACs/air rights in Urban Operations. 

 • I have recently worked as a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) at the [Terner Center for Housing Innovation](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/) with Prof. Carolina Reid, analyzing access to credit in BIPOC communities in the U.S, using **home mortgage microdata**.

 • Recently, I co-authored [a policy report](https://reinventalbany.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Reinvent-Albany_SCEPA-Penn-Station-Redevelopment-Report-2022-July-12.pdf) with Bridget Fisher (the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis), shining a light onto the use of **land value capture** to finance Penn Station's redevelopment plan in NYC. This research was featured in some media outlets, such as [The NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/nyregion/penn-station-renovation-funding.html) and [NY Daily News](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-edit-penn-station-finances-20220718-f5jkok5ar5fkfdf66a4jxaiaiy-story.html)

 • I am co-creator and regular co-host of the [Sur-Urbano podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1hD093fkWBYB0S6f2h3epH), an initiative of the Latin American Cities working group at UC Berkeley.
