## ABOUT
I am a PhD student in the Department of City and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley and a Graduate Student Researcher at the [Terner Center for Housing Innovation](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/). Prior to commencing my PhD, I worked in public and private sector organizations for nine years on issues of housing and land use policy, real estate markets, and urban economic development in Brazil and the U.S. During this period I also pursued my passion for public policy as a research associate at the [Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis](https://www.economicpolicyresearch.org/), and as an independent researcher for the [Lincoln Institute of Land Policy](https://www.lincolninst.edu/).  I hold a Bachelor in Economics from the University of São Paulo and a Master’s degree in Urban and Policy Analysis from The New School. I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil.




## RESEARCH INTEREST
I am interested in exploring the role of land and housing policies in advancing or limiting **wealth inequality**. My current research focuses on how federal policies of **access to credit** and local **land use and housing** policies act and interact to favor or hinder the wealth-building of different economic, social, and racial groups in Brazil. Within this theme, some issues that I would like to engage are: (i) if and how families capitalize on the **formal homeownership** offered by certain public programs; (ii) ways of providing housing assistance (ex. supply side versus demand side policies); (iii) the limits and potentialities of the concept of **housing financialization** to refer to policies implemented in the Global South; (iv) whether ownership restricts mobility and reduces low-income peoples' ability to change jobs.

I hope to integrate quantitative methods, particularly causal inference, and qualitative methods, such as interviewing and observation, to answer these questions.



## RECENT AND ONGOING PROJECTS
 • I currently work at the [Terner Center for Housing Innovation](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/) with Prof. Carolina Reid, analyzing access to credit in BIPOC communities in the U.S, using home mortgage microdata.

 • Recently, I co-authored [a policy report](https://reinventalbany.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Reinvent-Albany_SCEPA-Penn-Station-Redevelopment-Report-2022-July-12.pdf) with Bridget Fisher (the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis), shining a light onto the use of **land value capture** to finance Penn Station's redevelopment plan in NYC. This research was featured in some media outlets, such as [The NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/nyregion/penn-station-renovation-funding.html) and [NY Daily News](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-edit-penn-station-finances-20220718-f5jkok5ar5fkfdf66a4jxaiaiy-story.html)

 • Also, I've just interviewed in the [Sur-Urbano podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1hD093fkWBYB0S6f2h3epH) Martim Smolka, who has been the director of the Latin American and Caribbean program at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.
