## About
I am a PhD student in the Department of City and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley and a Graduate Student Researcher at the [Terner Center for Housing Innovation](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/). Prior to commencing my PhD, I worked in public and private sector organizations for nine years on issues of housing and land use policy, real estate markets, and urban economic development in Brazil and the U.S. During this period I also pursued my passion for urban and public policy issues as a research associate at the [Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis](https://www.economicpolicyresearch.org/), and as an independent researcher for the [Lincoln Institute of Land Policy](https://www.lincolninst.edu/).  I hold a Bachelor in Economics from the University of São Paulo and a Master’s degree in Urban and Policy Analysis from The New School. I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil.

## Research Interest
I am interested in exploring the role of land and housing policies in advancing or limiting **wealth inequality**. My current research focus is on how federal policies of **access to credit** and local policies of **inclusionary zoning** interact, favoring or hindering the wealth-building of different economic, social, and racial groups in Brazil and the U.S. Within this theme, some sub-questions that I plan to explore are: (i) how real estate developers shape, respond and adapt to these public policies; (ii) what is the role of regulation in supporting or hindering investors' activities in the formal housing sector?; (iii) is **housing financialization** an adequate concept to refer to housing policies implemented in the Global South?; (iv) how federal and local policies impact **informal housing/land markets**?

I hope to integrate quantitative/computational methods with qualitative methods to answer these questions.

## Recent and ongoing projects
 • I currently work at the [Terner Center for Housing Innovation](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/) with Prof. Carolina Reid, analyzing access to credit in BIPOC communities in the U.S, using home mortgage microdata.

 • Recently, I co-authored [a policy report](https://reinventalbany.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Reinvent-Albany_SCEPA-Penn-Station-Redevelopment-Report-2022-July-12.pdf) with Bridget Fisher (the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis), shining a light onto the use of **land value capture** to finance Penn Station's redevelopment plan in NYC.

 • Also, I've just interviewed in the [Sur-Urbano podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1hD093fkWBYB0S6f2h3epH) Martim Smolka, who has been the director of the Latin American and Caribbean program at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.
