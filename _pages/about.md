Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in [City & Regional Planning at UC Berkeley](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/city-regional-planning).    
My research revolves mostly around themes of `inequality`, XXXXXXX and **housing**.

In previous work at the [Center for Spatial Data Science at the University of Chicago](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/), I examined the sensitivity of **access metrics**, the **co-location** of large chain stores with smaller independent hardware stores, and the **demography of firms** in the United States by using life tables to analyze the probability at which different firm sizes survived or died over time in different geographies. Currently, I am also involved with [Berkeley's DLab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/) as a Data Science Fellow carrying out R Geospatial and US Census workshops for affiliated members of the University.
